//CASE 1(Active): Player health DOESN'T regen automatically after not taking damage for a while
//CASE 2: Player health regens automatically after not taking damage for a while


Recoil:
Recoil reset time scales to a max amount with the control yaw deviation from first first bullet


BUGS:
1. If player jumps while sprinting and lets go of sprint key mid-jump, he will be locked in the state of sprinting whenever moving forward
2. Full auto firing recoil is broken. Controlling the recoil still leads to the gun going down lower than expected

TODO:
1. Press escape to close pause menu
